## Description
This is an express app hooked up to a mongoDB database hosted remotely in Mongo Atlas via Mongoose. However I have also included queries for both console and Mongo Compass environments to make certain that I meet the assessment requirements. These two queries satisfy the business questions much the same as the SQL queries did in the previous assessment.

## How to run
Change directory into this directory with the cd command and then run "npm install" to install the dependencies. After which, you can run npm start to start the server on port 5001. Navigating to localhost/5001/ will display the JSON result from the query that returns all results from the database collection.
